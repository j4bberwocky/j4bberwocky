# 👋 Hi, I'm Tommaso

I'm a Software Architect focused on building pragmatic, scalable, resilient, and evolvable systems.

I enjoy turning complexity into clarity and enabling teams to deliver with confidence.

## 🧭 What I Do

- Architecture design for distributed and event‑driven systems  
- Cloud & DevOps (Azure, AWS, containers, CI/CD)  
- API & integration design (REST, messaging, event streaming)
- Empower teams through autonomy
- Software engineering practices (clean code, refactoring, performance)  
- Technical leadership and architectural guidance  

## 🧩 Architectural Philosophy

I view architecture as a dynamic balance between **Pragmatism** and **Evolution**. My goal is to help and enpower teams to build solutions that deliver value today without compromising the ability to change tomorrow.

My architectural choices are guided by two main pillars:

- **Pragmatism** (YAGNI & KISS): I prioritize simplicity. I build what is necessary now, avoiding over-engineering and speculative features. If a simple solution meets the requirements, it is the right solution.
- **Evolutionary Design:** I treat architecture as a living system. I design for change by ensuring high modularity, clear boundaries, and *fitness functions* that allow the system to adapt as the business grows.

A healthy architecture is one that solves today's problems efficiently while remaining open to the innovations of next year.
