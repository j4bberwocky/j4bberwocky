# 👋 Hi, I'm Tommaso

I'm a Software Architect focused on building scalable, resilient, and evolvable systems.  
I enjoy turning complexity into clarity and enabling teams to deliver with confidence.

## 🧭 What I Do

- Architecture design for distributed and event‑driven systems  
- Cloud & DevOps (Azure, AWS, containers, CI/CD)  
- API & integration design (REST, messaging, event streaming)  
- Software engineering practices (clean code, refactoring, performance)  
- Technical leadership and architectural guidance  

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Area | Technologies |
|------|--------------|
| **Languages** | Java, TypeScript, Python, Go |
| **Frameworks** | .NET, Node.js, React |
| **Cloud** | Azure, AWS |
| **DevOps** | Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Terraform |
| **Data & Messaging** | SQL/NoSQL, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis |

## 🧩 Architectural Philosophy

I see architecture as a living system: it changes, adapts, and evolves.  
For this reason, I design solutions that:

- empower teams through autonomy  
- rely on clear contracts and well‑defined boundaries  
- favor events and flows over rigid structures  
- balance governance with freedom  

A healthy architecture is one that keeps working even when everything around it changes.
